# Owarimonogatari

These are .ass subtitles edited from HorribleSubs' release of Owarimonogatari.
Their video and subs are ripped from Crunchyroll, so I can only assume the original translation is either Crunchy's or perhaps done by Aniplex.
While I can't comment on the quality of the translation, it was obvious that it needed a good edit.

This is my first project and I'm learning on the job, but I'm confident I can make the dialogue read a lot better than the official release.
At first, I'll just be doing edits, but I intend to learn typesetting and hopefully release something more "professional" later.

Thanks for watching!
